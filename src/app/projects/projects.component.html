        Some Things Iâ€™ve Built.
    </h1>
    <p >
        I believe the best way to learn is by building, even if it means getting stuck and having to figure things out
        on my own. That's why I enjoy building things from scratch and using Google to troubleshoot any issues that come
        up.
